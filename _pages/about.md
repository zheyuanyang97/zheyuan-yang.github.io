I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Vodafone Chair, TU Dresden since October 2023. I received my BEng degree (First Honours & Top 1 in major study) and PhD in Information Engineering (supervised by Prof. Ying-Jun Angela Zhang) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019 and 2023, respectively. From January to May 2018, I was an exchange student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. During my last year of PhD study, I visited Prof. Bruno Clerckx's group at Imperial College London from January to May 2023.

Selected Honours and Awards
======
I am very grateful that CUHK has awarded me with more than 1.5 million HKD to support my undergraduate and PhD study. Without the generous financial aids, I would definitely not become who I am and know where to go. 
During my early childhood, I lived in a remote mountain village without my biological parents but families of my foster mom. They are diligent and kind farmers, and they treated me well. Twenty years ago, there were no electricity and proper toilets in the village. We drew drinking water from wells. The road leading to the town was muddy and rugged, and I walked through a really long and difficult journey to where I am now. Tremendous thanks to the kind people and kindness in my life.
